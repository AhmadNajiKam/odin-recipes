    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This is my mom's special homemade lasagna recipe with a 
        meaty, made-from-scratch tomato sauce and a deliciously 
        cheesy filling. A more traditional homemade lasagna filling
         would be made with ricotta but my mom's recipe calls for 
         a blend of small-curd cottage cheese and Parmesan. I have 
         found none better anywhere. Serve with a leafy green salad
          and crusty garlic bread. </p>
